This app was built using Postgres, Ruby on Rails, React JS, Material and Semantic UI

An app to manage and track donations, adoptions, and animals details for a resuce in Northeast Texas.

Future plans for the app include updated styling, switching to a serverless database to allow more flexibility as well as file structure clean up and a more secure login for admin.
